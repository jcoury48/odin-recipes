This first project was learning to write our proper HTML for a basic recipe website. I worked with HTML boilerplate and it provided needed repetition for unordered and ordered lists and working with paragraphs.  This repetition helps to engrain evertyhting into memory for me. I really enjoyed seeing the website come together over the course of the project.
